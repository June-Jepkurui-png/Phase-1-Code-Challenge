## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)

Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond to the correct grade based on the following criteria:

A > 79
B - 60 to 79
C - 59 to 49
D - 40 to 49
E - less than 40
### How It Works:
The function takes user input for a student's mark and determines the grade based on predefined grade boundaries.

## Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input (e.g., 80 km/h). If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it should print "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70 km/h), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

If the driver accumulates more than 12 demerit points, the program should print "License suspended".
### How It Works:
The program calculates demerit points based on how much the driver exceeds the speed limit and determines if the license should be suspended based on the demerit points accumulated.

## Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
Write a program that calculates an individualâ€™s Net Salary based on inputs of basic salary and benefits. The program should compute payee (tax), NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, gross salary, and net salary.

### How It Works:
The program uses predefined tax rates, NHIF deduction brackets, and NSSF contribution rates to compute deductions from the gross salary, resulting in the net salary.
